Please be reminded of our 2x maximum participation policy whereby program participants can only participate in a maximum of two VC Lab cohorts. \\nThat being said, if you have made it into a program once, chances are high that you will get in again. Make sure to update your application to reflect any progress you may have made since the last time you applied to further increase your chances of getting in.\\n\\nBased on the above, I will deactivate your Portal and Slack accounts, at which point you will be able to move your application in 1 click to the open admissions period of your choice.\\nLooking forward to working with you again soon!\\nBest,",\

        template: "Hey Sabrina,\\nWe're not the fund size police. That being said, most large institutions do not back new managers because there is no track record to diligence for the fund. For you to get this fund done, you will need multiple tickets in the $5m range, and those types of ticket writers are not only extremely unlikely to invest (especially in 2023), but most are prevented by charter to make this type of investment. In the unlikely event they are not prevented by charter, the majority are majorly over-allocated in VC and are going to be extremely conservative with their investment strategy.\\n\\nWe strongly recommend that you drop this fund size to $10m or less and over-subscribe if things go well. Focus on HNWI. They will fund the vast majority of this fund. Maybe, if things go extremely well, you will get a family office in Fund 1. Even then, the family office is unlikely to come into your 1st close and you will likely not be able to have enough information to fill in their investor questionnaires.",\
